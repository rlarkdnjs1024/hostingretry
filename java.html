<p>style="margin-top:25px;">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement <b>complex 
    features</b> on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for 
    you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video j
    ukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of sta
    ndard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

<p>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:<br>
Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
